### man

man is a command you can use with an argument of another command. In other words, you can take a command you don't know how to use and learn about it using man before it's name. For example, the ls command. <code> man ls </code> will list the options and how to use ls. Sometimes Man pages are extensive. To leave a man page use the key combination of *CTRL + C*.
<p>
 Note: CTRL + C is what you use to exit a CLI tool if the prompt isn't showing up. Try using command <code> yes </code> and pressing enter. Notice the prompt starts to list the letter y over and over and doesn't let me you enter any other commands. Use *CTRL + C* to exit
