## Overview of Nano Server

Nano Server is a unique way to install a server machine with a lightway footprint that allows for remote managment similar to Core. Nano Server works well with Cloud based development and running "born-in-the-cloud" containers or applications. It's a headless install, meaning itâ€™s a server without a monitor and keyboard and peripherals. Specifically meant to be logged into to manage.

## The benefits of lightweight
The purpose of Nano is to be light weight. The small footprint allows for better security, quick install times, fast restarting, less resources, etc. Windows Server 2016 is typically much heavier than it needs to be for running things like micro-services, 'cloud-native' applications, containers, etc. Nano is sufficent for services like DNS, small web server (IIS), and being a storage host for a Scale-Out File Server.
