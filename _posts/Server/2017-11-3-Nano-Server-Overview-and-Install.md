## Overview of Nano Server

Nano Server is a unique way to install a server machine with a lightway footprint that allows for remote managment similar to Core. Nano Server works well with Cloud based development and running "born-in-the-cloud" containers or applications. It's a headless install, meaning itâ€™s a server without a monitor and keyboard and peripherals. Specifically meant to be logged into to manage.
