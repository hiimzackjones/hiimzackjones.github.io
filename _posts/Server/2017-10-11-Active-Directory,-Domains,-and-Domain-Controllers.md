# Active Directory, Domains, and Domain Controllers

These three topics can seem to be almost the same thing, and for that I'm dedicating a whole post to them. I'm going to make this quick.

### Servers
Servers are computers that serve out services. Services mean things like giving computers names to be aliases to their IP address, hosting files for multiple computers to access, hosting files in the form of a website, streaming video, or even to hold the contents of an application. 

### Enterprise Environment
The computer systems infrastructure of a particular corporation, business, or organization that is often made up of servers and hosts and other end devices such as printers. Most enterprise environments are designed to give the organization a safe system for maintaining preparatory data storage and working together, while also having the ability to have various layers and segmentation. That's a good enough definition for now. 

### Hostnames
Hostnames are made up of the machine name as well as the Domain name. For example Finance1.sweetbusiness.com would be a full host name. That host name relates directory to an IP address of a machine. 
A good example of a hostname that happens often would be ftp.business.com, which generally would be what you would assign an FTP server as.
 
### Domain


*todo* 
- Create a Domain User
- Create a Domain Group
- Create a Domain Orgainizational Unit


 
 
... This post is well on it's way.
