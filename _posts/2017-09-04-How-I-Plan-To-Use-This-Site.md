## What even?
So after playing with a handful of static website templates and hosts and things. I've landed on using Github pages to make my site. Before deciding to make a site, I had already decided to use Github once a week to develop some small bits of code for general practice. Python or some scripts or maybe some fun stuff like Arduino. 

## What to look for?

I plan to organize my notes into class subjects
- Linux & Unix
- Cisco
- Windows Server 2016

As well as some other general topics as well like 
- Kali Tools
- CTFs 
- General Networking

I haven't finished working out the details on directorys and things on the site, so for now it's just going to be a single feed on the main page. Sorryyyyy. If you're looking for a post with a paticular topic just use the good ole Find feature <code> CTRL + F </code>. 

## Plans
Right now I'm trying to catch up on publishing some notes from the class periods we have already went through. It might take some time. Afterwards I'll start adding some extra things. I have a IP Address and Subnet post I will be throwing up shortly as well as What is Github/Git/Github Pages, maybe even how to use Jekyll (making this website). It could be a good introduction for writing some code and hosting things on a repo. Please let me know if anything is broken on the site. If there are topics you think would be nice to have up let me know as well.
