# Hey hi hello.
I've been publishing my notes, writeups, and blogs here since 2017. It's all very nerdy stuff but if you're interested take a look around. There are plenty of posts on Networking, Linux, and Cybersecurity in here. If you're looking for writeups, head over to the InfoSec section. 

If you want to read my first post about what this site is about [here is your link](/blog/2017/09/15/HelloWorld.html) bub.
