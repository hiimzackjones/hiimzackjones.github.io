<p>If you’re looking at this you’ve probably been linked to it via my resume or some other professional network. Thanks for swinging by. Loosen up your tie and grab a drink. I hope after reading this I sound like a pretty cool guy and maybe what you’re looking for.</p>

<p>Okay so, by now you’ve figured out my name is Zack and I’m 30 and I do cyber security things. Here is the shortest version of the story.</p>

<h1 id="highschool">Highschool</h1>
<p>Mesmerized by media’s depiction of ‘hackers’ from movies like The Matrix, Hackers, 007 Goldeneye (Boris’ pen twirl is a must have skill for any hacker), and loads of other movies, hacking seemed to be some sort of high calibur, techno genius level magic trick show and I couldn’t get enough of it. But of course that meant massive intimidation. These people were super heroes in their own way.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until a keyboarding class in 9th grade that I began dabbling. See I had mastered typing way before this class, making every 30 minute assignment about 10 minutes long and it was a 45 minute class. So like any other bored chap in 2004, all I wanted to do was watch cartoons on Newgrounds.com but it was blocked. The Barracuda filter mocking me each time I tried. So I found a site. Hackthissite.org had a post on barracuda filters and I quickly learned that it blocked based off of some weird thing called DNS and if I didn’t resolve the names, it wouldn’t get blocked. I went home and had my first round with the command prompt. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ping newgrounds.com</code>. And it spit out the most magical set of numbers. The next day at school I did a little <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://51.79.77.158/</code> in the browser and of course followed it with a “We’re in”.</p>

<p>I was watching as much <em>Salad Fingers</em> and <em>Weebl and Bob</em> a 14 year old could fit in during a 45 minute class. But it was the site that taught me all this that opened my eyes. There was an actual site called Hack this site. Insane. This site became my only pasttime. I quickly was yelled at by strangers on the internet in posts telling me</p>
