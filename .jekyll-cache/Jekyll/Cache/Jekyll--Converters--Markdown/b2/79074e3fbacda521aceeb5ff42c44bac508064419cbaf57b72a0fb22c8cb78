<p>Okay so, by now youâ€™ve figured out my name is Zack and Iâ€™m 30 and I do cyber security things. Here is the shortest version of the story.</p>

<h1 id="highschool">Highschool</h1>
<p>Mesmerized by mediaâ€™s depiction of â€˜hackersâ€™ from movies like The Matrix, Hackers, 007 Goldeneye (Borisâ€™ pen twirl is a must have skill for any hacker), and loads of other movies, hacking seemed to be some sort of high calibur, techno genius level magic trick show and I couldnâ€™t get enough of it. But of course that meant massive intimidation. These people were super heroes in their own way.</p>

<p>It wasnâ€™t until a keyboarding class in 9th grade that I began dabbling. See I had mastered typing way before this class, making every 30 minute assignment about 10 minutes long and it was a 45 minute class. So like any other bored chap in 2004, all I wanted to do was watch cartoons on Newgrounds.com. Of course a website with bloody and sometimes adult themed games was 100%,no way around it, blocked. The Barracuda filter mocking me each time I tried. So I found a site. Hackthissite.org had a post on barracuda filters and I quickly learned that it blocked based off of some weird thing called DNS and if I didnâ€™t resolve the names, it wouldnâ€™t get blocked. I went home and had my first round with the command prompt. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ping newgrounds.com</code>. And it spit out the most magical set of numbers. The next day at school I did a little <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://51.79.77.158/</code> in the browser and of course followed it with a â€œWeâ€™re inâ€.</p>

<p>I was watching as much <em>Salad Fingers</em> and <em>Weebl and Bob</em> a 14 year old could fit in during a 45 minute class. But it was the site that taught me all this that opened my eyes. There was an actual site called Hack this site. Insane. This site became my only pasttime. I quickly was yelled at by strangers on the internet in posts telling me</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>â€œâ€¦ freaking script kiddie. learn html, javascript, how computers work before you come in and ask how to hack somethingâ€¦â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So thatâ€™s what I did. For the next 6 years or so. Learning Javascript injection, SQL, HTML, how cookies worked, and how to watch non SSL http traffic. This is where the CTFs and challenges began.</p>

<p>Youâ€™d think that with my interest being in Cyber Security Iâ€™d try to go to school for it, but from what the advisors said, my best bet was Cisco CCNA and that Iâ€™d be better off considering engineering or becoming a programmer/developer. It seemed like the skillset and excitement for breaking things would only be useful if I did something legally questionable and hope that the authorities or company find me usefulâ€¦ and I wasnâ€™t really interested in taking that kind of risk. So I went to school for engineering and the fun cyber stuff became a really niche replacement for videogames.</p>
