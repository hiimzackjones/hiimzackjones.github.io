<p>Okay so, by now you’ve figured out my name is Zack and I’m 30 and I do cyber security things. Here is the shortest version of the story.</p>

<h4 id="highschool">Highschool</h4>
<p>Mesmerized by media’s depiction of ‘hackers’ from movies like The Matrix, Hackers, 007 Goldeneye (Boris’ pen twirl is a must have skill for any hacker), and loads of other movies, hacking seemed to be some sort of high calibur, technology genius level magic trick show and I couldn’t get enough of it. But of course that meant massive intimidation. These people were super heroes in their own way. It wasn’t until a keyboarding class in 9th grade that I began dabbling. See I had mastered typing way before this class and it was a 45 minute class. All I wanted to do was watch cartoons on Newgrounds.com but it was blocked. The Barracuda filter mocking me each time I tried. So I found a site. Hackthissite.org had a post on barracuda filters and I quickly learned that it blocked based off of some weird thing called DNS and if I didn’t resolve the names, it wouldn’t get blocked. So with a little <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://51.79.77.158/</code> I was watching as much <em>Salad Fingers</em> and <em>Weebl and Bob</em> a 14 year old could fit in during a 45 minute class.</p>
