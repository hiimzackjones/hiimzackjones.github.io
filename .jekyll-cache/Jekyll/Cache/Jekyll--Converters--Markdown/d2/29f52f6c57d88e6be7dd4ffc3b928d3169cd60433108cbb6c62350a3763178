<h4 id="note-i-had-planned-on-calling-this-website-the-notebook-but-im-not-a-ryan-g-fan-and-i-wouldnt-want-anyone-to-get-their-hopes-up">Note: I had planned on calling this website ‚ÄúThe Notebook‚Äù but I‚Äôm not a Ryan G fan and I wouldn‚Äôt want anyone to get their hopes up.</h4>

<p>Anyway, In efforts to fully grasp my inner nerd and technologist tendencies, I made a site. This site is made with Jekyll and is hosted on Github.io. I write all my posts using Markdown and I use VIM as my editor.</p>

<h2 id="where-is-the-juice">Where is the juice?</h2>
<p>If you are here you are most likely here for the nerdy stuff. The notes, the exercises, something other than me. So I‚Äôll spare you the memes and gifs. Okay, I‚Äôm lying‚Ä¶ There will be plenty of memes. But I‚Äôll make sure to focus on the meat and potatoes for you guys.</p>

<h2 id="meat-and-potatoes-starts-here">Meat and Potatoes starts here.</h2>
<p>This is how it goes.</p>

<p>My intentions are to organize notes for classes by their subject. So far the subjects contain:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/Linux/">Linux</a></li>
  <li><a href="/networking">Networking</a></li>
  <li><a href="/Cisco">Cisco</a></li>
  <li><a href="/Server">Windows Server 2016</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Also as I move towards my OSCP you‚Äôll see plenty of that stuff too. So in the <a href="/InfoSec">InfoSec section</a> you‚Äôll find:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kali Tools</li>
  <li>CTFs</li>
  <li>General Networking</li>
  <li>Pentesting</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-else">What else?</h2>
<p>Check with me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/mehhsecurity">@Mehhsecurity</a> to keep up with when I post. Because this is a blog, you can also subscribe to it as an RSS.</p>

<p>Okay. Fingers crossed this won‚Äôt be the only post for the rest of eternity.</p>
