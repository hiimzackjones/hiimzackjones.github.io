I"'<p>Alright let’s talk about Lame for a second. Lame is another great box for practicing for the OSCP. This box is similar to the Legacy box in that it’s pretty easy to hop into. It’s CVE focused and as long as you know how to enumerate, then use tools to search and even Google for the CVEs and vulnerabilities then you should be gucci. If this is your first box that is fine, but I would highly recommend checking out <a href="/infosec/2020/05/15/Legacy-HTB-Writeup.html">Legacy</a> first. Feel free to use my writeup for that one as well.</p>
