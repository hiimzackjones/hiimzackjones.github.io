<p>If you‚Äôre looking at this you‚Äôve probably been linked to it via my resume or some other professional network. Thanks for swinging by. Loosen up your tie and grab a drink. This is the official long form of the resume, filling in all the gaps. I hope after reading this I sound like a pretty cool guy and maybe what you‚Äôre looking for.

<h1 id="who-i-am">Who I am</h1>

<p>Okay so, by now you‚Äôve figured out my name is Zack and I‚Äôm 30 and I do cyber security things. Here is the shortest version of the story.</p>

<h1 id="highschool">Highschool</h1>
<p>Mesmerized by media‚Äôs depiction of ‚Äòhackers‚Äô from movies like The Matrix, Hackers, 007 Goldeneye (Boris‚Äô pen twirl is a must have skill for any hacker), and loads of other movies, hacking seemed to be some sort of high calibur, techno genius level magic trick show and I couldn‚Äôt get enough of it. But of course that meant massive intimidation. These people were super heroes in their own way. The best magic trick I could ever do was the coin behind the ear thing.</p>

<p>It wasn‚Äôt until a keyboarding class in 9th grade that I began dabbling. See I had mastered typing way before this class, making every 30 minute assignment about 10 minutes long and it was a 45 minute class. So like any other bored chap in 2004, all I wanted to do was watch cartoons to pass the time. Specifically the beautiful internet treasure that is known as Newgrounds.com. Of course a website with bloody and sometimes adult themed games was 100%,no way around it, blocked. The Barracuda filter mocking me each time I tried. So I found a site. Hackthissite.org had a post on barracuda filters and I quickly learned that it blocked based off of some weird thing called DNS and if I didn‚Äôt resolve the names, it wouldn‚Äôt get blocked. I went home and had my first round with the command prompt. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ping newgrounds.com</code>. And it spit out the most magical set of numbers. The next day at school I did a little <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://51.79.77.158/</code> in the browser and of course followed it with a ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in‚Äù.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Resume/newgrounds.png" alt="2004 Newgrounds screenshot" /></p>

<p>I was watching as much <em>Salad Fingers</em> and <em>Weebl and Bob</em> a 14 year old could fit in during a 45 minute class. But it was the site that taught me all this that opened my eyes. There was an actual site called Hack this site. Insane. This site became my only pasttime. I quickly was yelled at by strangers on the internet in posts telling me</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>‚Äú‚Ä¶ freaking script kiddie. learn html, javascript, how computers work before you come in and ask how to hack something‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So that‚Äôs what I did. For the next 6 years or so. Learning Javascript injection, SQL, HTML, how cookies worked, and how to watch non SSL http traffic. This is where the CTFs and challenges began.</p>

<h1 id="college">College</h1>
<p>You‚Äôd think that with my interest being in Cyber Security I‚Äôd try to go to school for it, but this is 2007/2008 and back then Cyber Security was different. From what the advisors said, my best bet was Cisco CCNA and that I‚Äôd be better off considering engineering or becoming a programmer/developer. It seemed like the skillset and excitement for breaking things would only be useful if I did something legally questionable and hope that the authorities or company find me useful‚Ä¶ and I wasn‚Äôt really interested in taking that kind of risk. So I went to school for engineering and the fun cyber stuff became a really niche replacement for videogames.</p>

<h1 id="hacking-as-a-hobby">Hacking as A Hobby</h1>
<p>For the next few years after deciding that Cyber Security wouldn‚Äôt be a field I could get into. I continued to test my skills in any way I could that was‚Ä¶ahem‚Ä¶legal. I found sites like Vulnhub.com, Hackthebox.eu, ctflearn.com, and spent loads of time watching Hak5 and metasploit minute. I even set up a small lab using a outdated gaming computer I had built during college. If I ran into a machine with a vulnerability I had never seen before, I dug into it and studied it. My goal at this point was just to get profiecient enough to be good at conference CTFs.</p>

<h1 id="the-turnaround">The Turnaround</h1>
<p>Roughly in 2015, a friend of mine asked me about the CTFs and the challenges and asked what it was about. He told me that the local college had a Cyber Security program now and it was all over the news that talent in the field was hard to come by and that things had changed. So at 26 I went back to college. I expected to be the underdog in all the classes, assuming my self taught level of knowledge would barely be able to get me past the first semester. Come to find out, I was way ahead of the curve. This was the boost that I needed to really start the professional part of my journey.</p>

<h1 id="the-professor">The Professor</h1>
<p>I had a Windows Server class my first semester. My advisor told me that she felt I could jump a few classes based off of what the professors were saying. So I started the class. I had broken into a few Active Directory boxes before and had studied group policy so I was fairly experienced at the topic. About 4 weeks in the professor asked me if I was interested in a Networking internship. I told him I had bills and I couldn‚Äôt be taking on unpaid work. ‚ÄúZack, listen to me when I say this‚Äù</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I‚Äôm moving and quiting my other job as IT Director and you know more than any CCNA certifed applicant I‚Äôve talked to‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Six months later I was hired as the IT Director, and the only IT employee at a private military school with roughly 300 users, 30 switches, 35 access points, Barracuda web filters, web shaping hardware, and a weird combination of Windows Server and Novell. Needless to say my two years spent as IT Director was a learning experience, but just futher fed my desire to keep going.</p>

<h1 id="chasing-the-oscp">Chasing the OSCP</h1>
<p>So here we are. This is now. I won‚Äôt write a lot about this here. I will most likely blog the whole process from start to finish on a seperate post. Here are some of the key notes on how I‚Äôve learned.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Find a Udemy class designed for OSCP</li>
  <li>Find a professional that will willing to be your mentor. Find more than one. Talk to as many people as you can about their process and to make assesment on your skillset.</li>
  <li>Do any and every Easy or Medium HacktheBox.eu box you can. <em>as far as using writeups or not, always have a writeup ready for reference if you get stuck, but don‚Äôt use it as step by step instructions if you can help it</em></li>
  <li>Google how to enumerate each port you find. Make notes.</li>
  <li>Write what you‚Äôve done. Take the time to do this. Write the most basic version of what your process was like. A few weeks or months later, go back to edit the notes, forcing you to follow them and re-work the box.</li>
</ul>
