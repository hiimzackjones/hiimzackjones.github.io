I"¶<p>Hyper-V has extensive software defined network capabilities allowing an admin to create elaboriate networking, isolating host VMs, Vlans, Link Aggregation, and Load Balancing.</p>

<p>There are a couple of places you can Management parts of the virtual network. First, you will want to go to the Virtual Switch Settings in Hyper-V to be able to do basic switch configuration.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In Hyper-V Manager, go to the actions bar and select the Hyper-V Switch Manager<br />

  <li>In the switch manager, you should see any switches youâ€™ve created, as well as the default switch. 
<img src="/assets/img/servergifs/hyperVN/2.PNG" alt="HyperV" /></li>
  <li>here you can configure your switch to be external, internal, or private. As explained in another postâ€¦</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Private</em> - isolation from the rest of the network, VMs on the same host can connect together with this setting. 
<em>Internal</em> - Same as Private but can also communicate with the host as well.
<em>External</em> - Faces the network like a physical machine.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Machines that are on Private or Internal networks will usually have to have their IP addresses set unless there is a DHCP server on a VM or on the host machine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If youâ€™ve set up the switch as external, you will need to link it to an external switch if youâ€™d like to allow it to get to the outside network or internet.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Once youâ€™ve setup the switches, you should be able to access them to change their IP addresses and adjust some of their settings in your local machines network adapter list.<br />

As you can see, there is a default switch, A switch with a custom name. And then individual switches most likely used as external switches for single VMs.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="changing-a-vms-switch">Changing a VMs Switch</h3>

<p>Changing the Virtual Switch you use can be handled in the VMs settings.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Head to the vm settings for the specific VM youâ€™re working on within Hyper-V Manager</li>
  <li>Under hardware there will be a Legacy Network Adapter section. Go there.</li>
  <li>There you will see a drop down for the Vritual Switch youâ€™d like to use.

  <li>Once youâ€™ve changed the settings you can apply the settings and quit out.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="nic-teaming">NIC Teaming</h3>
<p>Under the Legacy Network Adapter option in the Hyper-V Settings, you will see the dropdown for Advanced Features. Here you can add a handful of advanced features, one including NIC teaming. Select this if you want a NIC to be allow to be part of NIC teaming.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s the basics!</p>
