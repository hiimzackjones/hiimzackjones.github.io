I"πA<p><em>some of this post is still being edited. Posting draft early by request.</em></p>

<p>The Legacy HTB machine was one of the first HTB machines I ever broke into. It‚Äôs a retired box that is pretty basic, leaning towards understanding basic methodology and how to make use of CVEs that you find on a box. It‚Äôs a good start for practicing for the OSCP.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Walkthroughs/Legacy/Website_shot.png" alt="Website Screenshot" /></p>

<p>If this writeup isn‚Äôt enough, HTB does include <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/2">a writeup</a> on the site. There are also plenty of videos online how to do this box as well.</p>

<p><strong>Okay let‚Äôs get into it</strong></p>

<h3 id="scanning-the-machine">Scanning the machine</h3>
<p>So from HTB we already know the IP address is <code>10.10.10.4</code> so as long as our openvpn connection is setup we should be able to start banging on it.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm going to scan this in a few different ways. First let‚Äôs do a basic nmap.</p>

<h4 id="basic-nmap">Basic nmap</h4>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>nmap 10.10.10.4
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>or in case it has trouble</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>nmap -Pn 10.10.10.4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Walkthroughs/Legacy/basic_nmap.png" alt="Basic nmap scan" /></p>

<p>This scan will give us some basic information. It‚Äôs good to do this scan first to see if there are any ports you can start to enumearte while waiting for larger scans.<br />
From this we can guess it might have something to do with SMB. How?<br />
<strong>SMB</strong></p>
<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />Has older SMB port 139. SMB used to run on 139 on top of netbios</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />Has newer SMB port 445. After Windows 2000, SMB was moved to this port.<br />
It‚Äôs not enough for full confidence but it‚Äôs enough to start to see where we might be going with this.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let‚Äôs run a couple bigger scans.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The next two scans can be run back to back but if you run the nmapAutomator.sh script, it includes the nmap scan I‚Äôm about to show you.</p>

<h4 id="big-nmap-scan">‚ÄúBig nmap‚Äù scan</h4>
<p>I personally call this the big nmap. It‚Äôs a scan that will scan all ports, and run anything it can against it.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>nmap -T4 -A -p- 10.10.10.4
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>I kept <code>-Pn</code> just because.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Walkthroughs/Legacy/big_nmap.png" alt="big nmap " /></p>

<p>Before we run the next scan, lets go ahead and see what we can find from this.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Still looks like SMB</li>
  <li>SMB Security looks weak - <code>message_signing: disabled</code></li>
  <li>Evidence that it is an older Windows machine, most likely XP.</li>
  <li>Computer name is ‚ÄòLegacy‚Äô</li>
  <li>Workgroup is ‚ÄòHTB‚Äô</li>
  <li>Maybe possible to enumerate netbios</li>
  <li>Has directory services enabled</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay let‚Äôs run the nmapAutomator.sh scan.</p>

<h4 id="nmapautomatorsh">nmapAutomator.sh</h4>
<p>Before we run this scan, let‚Äôs talk about it a bit.<br />
nmapAutomator.sh is a bash script written by Github users <strong>21y4d, austinsonger, and Knowledge_Wisdom_Understanding</strong> and can be found on <a href="https://github.com/21y4d/nmapAutomator">Github here.</a></p>

<p>It will run a handful of scans at the same time for you including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>sslscan</li>
  <li>nikto</li>
  <li>wpscan</li>
  <li>smbmap</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>So let‚Äôs run a full scan and see how it goes.<br />
The scan is quite lengthy so I won‚Äôt be posting a screenshot of the whole thing, but if you want to see the whole scan, you can watch it here. <a href="https://asciinema.org/a/MnWeg5pekvWqu44AWeiSqOO9v"><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/MnWeg5pekvWqu44AWeiSqOO9v.svg" alt="asciicast" /></a></p>

<p>This scan basically just confirmed what we found from previous scans. But it did give some particularly interesting information on the SMB situation.
<img src="/assets/img/Walkthroughs/Legacy/nmapauto_vulns.png" alt="SMB Vulnerabilities" /></p>

<p>So now we know that this machine has two CVEs marked as vulnerable.</p>
<ul>
  <li>CVE-2008-4250</li>
  <li>CVE-2017-0143</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point we could probably start poking at these CVEs but let‚Äôs try to dig in a bit further before attacking the machine.</p>

<h4 id="netbios-enumeration">Netbios enumeration</h4>
<p>So with netbios there are a couple ways we can enumerate it. The first way is to run <code>nbtscan</code> on it to see what services we can see. We are looking for information about it being connected to a domain or a some sort of file server service.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>nbtscan -vh 10.10.10.4
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>After running this we see that it in fact has a file server service running as well as a few others listed. This is good information for us.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Walkthroughs/Legacy/nbtscan.png" alt="Nbtscan" /></p>

<h4 id="smb-enumeration">SMB enumeration</h4>
<p>Okay so when we ran our big nmap scan we got plenty of information on SMB but let‚Äôs just run some SMB specific enumerations real fast just for the heck of it. Let‚Äôs start with smbclient.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>smbclient -L \\\\10.10.10.4\\\
smbclient -N -L \\\10.10.10.4\\

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>smbclient is a small application similar to FTP. It may allow you to view files from the server. It also allows to put files on the server, view files, etc. In some cases you will be able to log in anonymously.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Walkthroughs/Legacy/smbclient.png" alt="smbclient" /></p>

<p>We aren‚Äôt getting much from it right now and that‚Äôs okay. Let‚Äôs keep poking around.</p>

<p><em>Note: smbmap is also a great tool for enumerating SMB, in paticular when working with Active Directory or domains.</em></p>

<p>Another way to enumerate SMB is to use nmap with the SMB script. We have already done this in the big nmap scan we did previously, but if you wanted to run it again it would look like this.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>nmap -p 445 --script smb-os-discovery 10.10.10.4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Lastly, you should know that Metasploit has amazing auxiliary scanners. You can use metasploit to search keywords and then go from there. You‚Äôll find an auxiliary module called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version</code> that is useful here. The steps here are basic.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use</code> and the module name.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">options</code> to view what needs to be set</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">set</code> each option as needed.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run</code> to run the module.</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>msf5 &gt; use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) &gt; options

Module options (auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version):

[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Sweet so this specifically tells us a few things.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Windows XP SP3</li>
  <li>Host name is LEGACY</li>
  <li>Workgroup is called HTB</li>
</ul>

<p>This is pretty good information to have.</p>
<h3 id="diggin-into-the-cves">Diggin into the CVEs</h3>

<p>So there are two CVEs that we noticed earlier. There are loads of ways to search these to find out more information about the machine. I always suggest doing a few different searches to find out basic information and also confirm what you‚Äôve read. If you‚Äôre just looking at one post, you‚Äôre probably missing out on a lot of information. Below is a bit of research I did on both CVEs. I‚Äôve included the links I felt were important as well.</p>

<p>Before we hit google, lets try a little <strong>searchsploit</strong>‚Ä¶ starting with <strong>CVE-2008-4250</strong></p>

<h4 id="cve-2008-4250">CVE-2008-4250</h4>

<p><strong>Searchsploit</strong>
<img src="/assets/img/Walkthroughs/Legacy/SearchSploit-MS08-067.png" alt="MS08-067 SearchSploit" /></p>

<p>Notice that when I searched for it by CVE I got nothing. That‚Äôs why searching in different places is so important. I knew to also search MS08-067 because of this next page‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>CVEDetails.com</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2008-4250/">CVE Details link</a><br />
<img src="/assets/img/Walkthroughs/Legacy/CVE-Details-2008-4250.png" alt="CVE Screenshot" /> <br />
The CVE Details page always gives loads of information. Here is the take away.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Allows for Remote Code Execution - <em>Exactly what we want to hear when trying to gain initial access</em></li>
  <li>Has Metasploit Module ;)</li>
  <li>Works on older Windows Servers between 2000-2008</li>
  <li>Highest level of risk - CVSS Score of 10</li>
  <li>Authentication not required for exploit</li>
  <li>Complexity is low</li>
  <li>Access gained - Admin</li>
  <li>Also known as MS08-067 (This is useful for doing further research)</li>
</ul>

<p>So in theory a metasploit module can <strong>do the work for us, get us in</strong>, and not only that but already <strong>be admin level</strong>. Note taken!</p>

<p><strong>Exploit-db.com</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/7132">Exploit-db link</a></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Walkthroughs/Legacy/EDB-7132.png" alt="EDB-7132" /></p>

<p>Okay so this is literally the exploit for this particular vulnerability published online. Great. From the site we can tell that</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is Verified by EDB to work.</li>
  <li>Written in python</li>
  <li>Has some python dependencies</li>
  <li>Takes arguments based on which OS you‚Äôre targeting, ie has multiple payloads</li>
  <li>Sets up a listener on port 4444</li>
  <li>exploit portion of the script is shellcode for a portbind that came from metasploit.</li>
  <li>Was listed ‚Äò7132.py‚Äô in our searchsploit results.</li>
</ul>

<p>If our enumeration has been correct so far, this is almost a stopping point. We know the OS, SMB version, the CVE, and the exploit. And everything lines up really well. Not a lot of chances for failure here. But always keep reading before firing something off, your little copy and paste pew pew could really wreck a machine if you‚Äôre not careful.</p>

<h4 id="cve-2017-0143">CVE-2017-0143</h4>
<p>Okay so before we dig into this. Think back to 2017 and try to remember some sort of massive worldwide scare involving SMB‚Ä¶ do you remember? Yeahhhhhh. WannaCry? This bad boy right here is also known as MS17-010. I imagine this machine could be broken into using either of these CVEs but I chased the above method. But for reference, here are some links.</p>

<p>https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41891<br />
https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-0143/</p>

<h4 id="exploitation-and-gaining-access">Exploitation and Gaining Access</h4>

<p><strong>Trying out CVE-2008-4250 aka MS08-067</strong></p>

<p>So this exploit has two methods, metasploit and of course finding the exploit online. Or I mean‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôre a big shot, maybe develop your own exploit.</p>

<h4 id="metasploit">Metasploit</h4>
<p>After I saw that metasploit was an option here, I quickly fired a metasploit missile at this silly boy. You can use the search function in metasploit to find a module called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi</code>. It was super easy to run. Note that sometimes exploits revolving around MS08-067 and MS17-010 can be finicky. You might have to try it a couple times. Here is what it looked like in metasploit.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Search for the exploit</li>
  <li>use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use</code> command and the name of the exploit</li>
  <li>check the options with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">options</code></li>
  <li>set necessary <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">options</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run</code></li>
</ul>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>msf5 &gt; use exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi

<p>Boom you‚Äôve got a meterpreter shell and if you check, you‚Äôre big boy admin with all the rights in the world. Yes this hack was pretty easy, yes it‚Äôs based off of a massive vulnerability that hit the news which means every IT guy and gal across the globe knows about it and hopefully that means they are all patched up. But. That is wishful thinking. I have to say the biggest value in this is that is was a really rewarding hack. It was my first HTB and for a lot of folks reading this, it‚Äôs probably theirs as well. Or‚Ä¶ it should be I would say. There is massive value in doing easy boxes like this for your confidence. It gives so much momentum that tackling harder boxes are just a little bit less scary. SO. That‚Äôs it. I hope this helps. If I said something stupid or lied or anything else, feel free to reach out.<br />
